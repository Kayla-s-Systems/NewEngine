# newengine-service-kit

Common helpers for `ServiceV1` implementations that expose JSON-control methods and engine-runtime provider-route candidates.

This crate is intentionally generic: domain crates still own DTOs, method constants and typed adapters. The kit only removes repeated `ServiceV1` boilerplate, JSON payload handling and engine-runtime provider-route registration ceremony.

## Directory purpose

**Path:** `NewEngine/neocore2/crates/newengine-service-kit`

**Role:** Service boundary, DTO adapter, or provider-facing service implementation.

**Local contents:** 1 direct subdirectories, 2 direct files.

**Direct file examples:** `Cargo.toml`

## Working rules

- Do not put transient build output in this directory unless the directory is explicitly a runtime output/cache location.
- Keep runtime assets and editable source assets separate: source assets are packed into runtime formats through explicit tools/manifests.
- Do not introduce hidden provider/backend coupling here; use declared descriptors, gateways, DTOs, and explicit maintenance scripts.
